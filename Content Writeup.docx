About Us ( 1st Page)

Centre of Learning for Autistic and Special scholars was started by Ms. Neelam Agarwal in year 2019. As a parent of Special child, she identified that while there are various therapies being practiced globally, there was a need of a 360 degree developmental program which touches each aspect of a child’s requirements ranging from Sensory,Occupational, Speech and expanding towards the skill development activities like dance, music, drama etc. under one roof.
 This approach will facilitate fellow Parents in getting all requirements being catered from one centre rather than going from pillar to post
