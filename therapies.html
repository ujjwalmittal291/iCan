                  <br>
                  Aquatic therapy techniques include:

                    Color therapy is an alternative therapy that uses colors and their frequencies to heal physical and emotional problems.
                    <br>
                    Color therapy is also known as chromopathy, chromotherapy, or color healing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The goal of color therapy is to correct physiological and psychological imbalances. For instance, if you're stressed, color therapy can help soothe you so that you can regain your psychological balance.
                    <br>
                    If you're depressed, color therapy can be used to invigorate you and give you increased energy.

                  <p>Acupressure is often called acupuncture without the needles. Instead of needles, acupressure involves the application of manual pressure (usually with the fingertips) to specific points on the body.
                    <br>
                    Most people try acupressure to manage symptoms of a condition, such as:

                    <br>
                    Adequate strength, coordination, and balance are needed to complete gross motor activities, which include things such as walking, running, climbing, jumping, and ball skills. 
                    <br>
                    Gross motor skills are often acquired in a predictable sequence. For example, children typically progress from crawling to walking to running.

                    <strong>
                      Fine Motor Skills are necessary to perform activities that involve manipulating items using the small muscles of the hands and fingers
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    Appropriate tone (muscle’s readiness to work), strength, coordination or dexterity, and feeling (sense of touch) is required to perform these tasks.  If a child has difficulty with any or all of these skills, then completing fine motor tasks can be difficult.
                    <br>
                    Many fine motor tasks involve <strong>bilateral coordination</strong>, which involves using two hands together to complete a task. Examples of these include writing, cutting, buttoning a shirt, or catching a ball. Visual motor skills and the ability to cross midline are also important skills needed for bilateral coordination activities.

                    <br>
                    Aromatherapy is thought of as both an art and a science. Recently, aromatherapy has gained more recognition in the fields of science and medicine.

                    <strong>Light Therapy</strong>
                    <br>
                    While light enters the body primarily through the eyes, it also enters through the skin and chakras. Light plays an important role in the body, stimulating and supporting the immune system, endocrine system, and other organs. The human body is especially tuned into colors, which have been linked to mood, emotions, and even physical health.

                    <strong>Sound Therapy</strong>
                    <br>
                    Sound therapy uses sound intentionally to create resonance, harmony, healing, and higher levels of conscious awareness. By instinct, we all recognize the vibration of sound and its effects. For example, loud explosive sounds produce fear, while focused sound brings about harmony and resonance.

                    Play therapy is a method of meeting and responding to the mental health needs of children and is extensively acknowledged by experts as an effective and suitable intervention in dealing with children’s brain development. It is generally employed with children aged 3 through 11 and provides a way for them to express their experiences and feelings through a natural, self-guided, self-healing process. As children’s experiences and knowledge are often communicated through play, it becomes an important vehicle for them to know and accept themselves and others.
