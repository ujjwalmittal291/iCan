        <div class="jumbotext" style="margin: 20px; font-size:16px;">
          <p>
            Centre of Learning for Autistic and Special scholars was started by Ms. Neelam Agarwal in year 2019. As a parent of Special child, she identified that while there are various therapies being practiced globally, there was a need of a 360 degree developmental program which touches each aspect of a child’s requirements ranging from Sensory,Occupational, Speech and expanding towards the skill development activities like dance, music, drama etc. under one roof.
            <br>
            This approach will facilitate fellow Parents in getting all requirements being catered from one centre rather than going from pillar to post

          <p>
            CLASS’s mission is to support those who enhance the growth and development of special children  through education, advocacy, community building, and research. We aim to help parents and families, education professionals including support service personnel, and members of the research and higher education community who work to help special children as they strive to achieve their personal best and contribute to their communities.
            <br>
            The Centre of Learning for Autistic and Special Scholars is dedicated to providing a safe, positive and stimulating learning environment that provides all interventions required to support our kids under one roof which enables the child to achieve personal excellence. Our Goal is to establish a specialty center well equipped with not only latest facilities but also trained personnel, providing good quality, affordable, up to date therapies with complete transparency to Parents.

          <p>
            We envision the Center of Learning for Autistic and Special Scholars to be an environment that provides all students with an individualized instructional program consisting of developmental, academic, and/or functional skills. Our Center:

              <li>Enables students to function as independently as possible with supports across the functional domains of daily living, recreation/leisure, community, vocational, communication/decision making.</li>
              <li>Prepares students for opportunities within the community</li>
              <li>Establishes alliances between the home, school and other agencies</li>
              <li>Secures a safe environment</li>
              <li>Demonstrates mutual respect and collaboration</li>
              <li>Utilizes effective teaching techniques and materials</li>
              <li>Provides the support to attain acceptably appropriate behavior</li>
              <li>Makes adaptations and accommodations to the environment</li>
              <li>Encourages continuous learning and growth for all stakeholders</li>
